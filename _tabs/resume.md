## Summary

I have 3 years experience in creating technical documentation, tutorials and content that are aimed at developers. I also have experience writing for non-technical audiences. During my time at Wagtail, I worked on improving the information architecture, writing contribution guidelines, writing tutorials, and improving the Developer and User Guide documentation.
